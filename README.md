# Chocolatey Packages for Genuine Tools

This is the repo for the Chocolatey packages for
[Genuine Tools](https://gallant-hopper-2d9209.netlify.com/).

This is not the source for Genuine Tools. Check the
[genuinetools](https://github.com/genuinetools) org on Github
for each of the tools.

If you find that a package is outdated, please send a PR.

## Install

You will need [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/). Install it, then run:

```powershell
choco install genuinetools
```

The above command gets all the tools. To get individual tools replace
`genuinetools` on the command above with the tool that you want. We are using
the original tools name from [Genuine
Tools](https://gallant-hopper-2d9209.netlify.com/).
You can also check the source to find the tools names.
